# Nvim Events

### https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dtr2300/2f867c2b6c051e946ef23f92bd9d1180/raw/80a82062d573cb15c68057a1c09fe9db83787ecf/nvim-events.md

Nvim recognizes the following events. Names are case-insensitive.

<details>
<summary>BufAdd</summary>

when it's used.  The pattern is matched
against the command name.  Both <amatch> and
<afile> expand to the command name.

</details>

<details>
<summary>ColorScheme</summary>

```
After loading a color scheme. |:colorscheme|
Not triggered if the color scheme is not

Non-recursive (event cannot trigger itself).
Cannot change the text. |textlock|

The size and position of the popup are also
available by calling |pum_getpos()|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>CompleteDonePre</summary>

```
After Insert mode completion is done.  Either
when something was completed or abandoning
completion. |ins-completion|
|complete_info()| can be used, the info is
cleared after triggering CompleteDonePre.
The |v:completed_item| variable contains
information about the completed item.
```
</details>

<details>

|v:completed_item| gives the completed item.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>CursorHold</summary>

```
When the user doesn't press a key for the time
specified with 'updatetime'.  Not triggered
until the user has pressed a key (i.e. doesn't
fire every 'updatetime' ms if you leave Vim to
make some coffee. :)  See |CursorHold-example|
for previewing tags.
This event is only triggered in Normal mode.
It is not triggered when waiting for a command
argument to be typed, or a movement after an
operator.
While recording the CursorHold event is not
triggered. |q|

Internally the autocommand is triggered by the
<CursorHold> key. In an expression mapping
|getchar()| may see this character.

Note: Interactive commands cannot be used for
this event.  There is no hit-enter prompt,
the screen is updated directly (when needed).
Note: In the future there will probably be
another option to set the time.
Hint: to force an update of the status lines
use: >
:let &ro = &ro
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>CursorHoldI</summary>

```
Like CursorHold, but in Insert mode. Not
triggered when waiting for another key, e.g.
after CTRL-V, and not in CTRL-X mode
|insert_expand|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>CursorMoved</summary>

```
After the cursor was moved in Normal or Visual
mode or to another window.  Also when the text
of the cursor line has been changed, e.g. with
"x", "rx" or "p".
Not always triggered when there is typeahead,
while executing commands in a script file, or
when an operator is pending. Always triggered
when moving to another window.
For an example see |match-parens|.
Note: Cannot be skipped with |:noautocmd|.
Careful: This is triggered very often, don't
do anything that the user does not expect or
that is slow.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>CursorMovedI</summary>

```
After the cursor was moved in Insert mode.
Not triggered when the popup menu is visible.
Otherwise the same as CursorMoved.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>DiffUpdated</summary>

```
After diffs have been updated.  Depending on
what kind of diff is being used (internal or
external) this can be triggered on every
change or when doing |:diffupdate|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>DirChanged</summary>

```
After the |current-directory| was changed.
The pattern can be:
"window"  to trigger on `:lcd`
"tabpage" to trigger on `:tcd`
"global"  to trigger on `:cd`
"auto"    to trigger on 'autochdir'.
Sets these |v:event| keys:
    cwd:            current working directory
    scope:          "global", "tabpage", "window"
    changed_window: v:true if we fired the event
                    switching window (or tab)
<afile> is set to the new directory name.
Non-recursive (event cannot trigger itself).
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>DirChangedPre</summary>

```
When the |current-directory| is going to be
changed, as with |DirChanged|.
The pattern is like with |DirChanged|.
Sets these |v:event| keys:
    directory:      new working directory
    scope:          "global", "tabpage", "window"
    changed_window: v:true if we fired the event
                    switching window (or tab)
<afile> is set to the new directory name.
Non-recursive (event cannot trigger itself).
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>ExitPre</summary>

```
When using `:quit`, `:wq` in a way it makes
Vim exit, or using `:qall`, just after
|QuitPre|.  Can be used to close any
non-essential window.  Exiting may still be
cancelled if there is a modified buffer that
isn't automatically saved, use |VimLeavePre|
for really exiting.
See also |QuitPre|, |WinClosed|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>FileAppendCmd</summary>

autocommand exists the warning message and
prompt is not given.
|v:fcs_reason| indicates what happened. Set
|v:fcs_choice| to control what happens next.

```
</details>

<details>
<summary>FilterReadPre</summary>

```
Before reading a file from a filter command.

when it's used.  The pattern is matched
against the function name.  Both <amatch> and
<afile> are set to the name of the function.
NOTE: When writing Vim scripts a better
alternative is to use an autoloaded function.
See |autoload-functions|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>UIEnter</summary>

```
After a UI connects via |nvim_ui_attach()|, or
after builtin TUI is started, after |VimEnter|.

Replace mode.  The |v:insertmode| variable
indicates the new mode.
Be careful not to move the cursor or do
anything else that the user does not expect.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>InsertCharPre</summary>

```
When a character is typed in Insert mode,

to more than one character this text is
inserted literally.

Cannot change the text. |textlock|
Not triggered when 'paste' is set.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>InsertEnter</summary>

```
Just before starting Insert mode.  Also for
Replace mode and Virtual Replace mode.  The
|v:insertmode| variable indicates the mode.
Be careful not to do anything else that the
user does not expect.
The cursor is restored afterwards.  If you do
not want that set |v:char| to a non-empty
string.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>InsertLeavePre</summary>

```
Just before leaving Insert mode.  Also when
using CTRL-O |i_CTRL-O|.  Be careful not to
change mode or use `:normal`, it will likely
cause trouble.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>InsertLeave</summary>

```
Just after leaving Insert mode.  Also when
using CTRL-O |i_CTRL-O|.  But not for |i_CTRL-C|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>MenuPopup</summary>

```
Just before showing the popup menu (under the
right mouse button).  Useful for adjusting the
menu for what is under the cursor or mouse
pointer.
The pattern is matched against one or two
characters representing the mode:
n    Normal
v    Visual
o    Operator-pending
i    Insert
c    Command line
tl   Terminal
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>ModeChanged</summary>

```
After changing the mode. The pattern is
matched against `'old_mode:new_mode'`, for
example match against `*:c` to simulate
|CmdlineEnter|.
The following values of |v:event| are set:
old_mode The mode before it changed.
new_mode The new mode as also returned
by |mode()| called with a
non-zero argument.
When ModeChanged is triggered, old_mode will
have the value of new_mode when the event was
last triggered.
This will be triggered on every minor mode
change.
Usage example to use relative line numbers
when entering visual mode: >
:au ModeChanged [vV\x16]*:* let &l:rnu = mode() =~# '^[vV\x16]'
:au ModeChanged *:[vV\x16]* let &l:rnu = mode() =~# '^[vV\x16]'
:au WinEnter,WinLeave * let &l:rnu = mode() =~# '^[vV\x16]'
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>OptionSet</summary>

```
After setting an option (except during
|startup|).  The |autocmd-pattern| is matched
against the long option name.  |<amatch>|
indicates what option has been set.

|v:option_type| indicates whether it's global
or local scoped.
|v:option_command| indicates what type of
set/let command was used (follow the tag to
see the table).
|v:option_new| indicates the newly set value.
|v:option_oldlocal| has the old local value.
|v:option_oldglobal| has the old global value.
|v:option_old| indicates the old option value.

|v:option_oldlocal| is only set when |:set|
or |:setlocal| or a |modeline| was used to set
the option. Similarly |v:option_oldglobal| is
only set when |:set| or |:setglobal| was used.

Note that when setting a |global-local| string
option with |:set|, then |v:option_old| is the
old global value. However, for all other kinds
of options (local string options, global-local
number options, ...) it is the old local
value.

OptionSet is not triggered on startup and for
the 'key' option for obvious reasons.

Usage example: Check for the existence of the
directory in the 'backupdir' and 'undodir'
options, create the directory if it doesn't
exist yet.

Note: Do not reset the same option during this
autocommand, that may break plugins. You can
always use |:noautocmd| to prevent triggering
OptionSet.

Non-recursive: |:set| in the autocommand does
not trigger OptionSet again.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>QuickFixCmdPre</summary>

```
Before a quickfix command is run (|:make|,
|:lmake|, |:grep|, |:lgrep|, |:grepadd|,
|:lgrepadd|, |:vimgrep|, |:lvimgrep|,
|:vimgrepadd|, |:lvimgrepadd|,
|:cfile|, |:cgetfile|, |:caddfile|, |:lfile|,
|:lgetfile|, |:laddfile|, |:helpgrep|,
|:lhelpgrep|, |:cexpr|, |:cgetexpr|,
|:caddexpr|, |:cbuffer|, |:cgetbuffer|,
|:caddbuffer|).
The pattern is matched against the command
being run.  When |:grep| is used but 'grepprg'
is set to "internal" it still matches "grep".
This command cannot be used to set the
'makeprg' and 'grepprg' variables.
If this command causes an error, the quickfix
command is not executed.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>QuickFixCmdPost</summary>

```
Like QuickFixCmdPre, but after a quickfix
command is run, before jumping to the first
location. For |:cfile| and |:lfile| commands
it is run after the error file is read and
before moving to the first error.
See |QuickFixCmdPost-example|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>QuitPre</summary>

```
When using `:quit`, `:wq` or `:qall`, before
deciding whether it closes the current window
or quits Vim.  For `:wq` the buffer is written
before QuitPre is triggered.  Can be used to
close any non-essential window if the current
window is the last ordinary window.
See also |ExitPre|, |WinClosed|.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>RemoteReply</summary>

```
When a reply from a Vim that functions as
server was received server2client().  The
pattern is matched against the {serverid}.
<amatch> is equal to the {serverid} from which
the reply was sent, and <afile> is the actual
reply string.
Note that even if an autocommand is defined,
the reply should be read with remote_read()
to consume it.
```
</details>

<details>

```
</details>

<details>
