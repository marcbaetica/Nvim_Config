COLOR SCHEME AND FONT CONFIGURATION:

https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/fonts.html#font-related-configuration

WezTerm ships with over 700 color schemes available from iTerm2-Color-Schemes, base16, Gogh and terminal.sexy and a couple of other locations.

config.color_scheme = "Catppuccin Macchiato"


https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/appearance.html#defining-your-own-colors

By default, WezTerm bundles JetBrains Mono, Nerd Font Symbols and Noto Color Emoji fonts and uses those for the default font configuration.

config.font = wezterm.font("JetBrains Mono Medium")
config.font_size = 16

... also need fallback font
https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/wezterm/font_with_fallback.html?h=jet+brains+mono
for nvim opened directly through cmd a fallback font would support emojis



DEBUGGING Wezterm:

Ctrl + Shift + L (default config) activates the debug overlay which contains the most recently logged issues as well as a Lua REPL for evaluating built-in lua functions.

WEZTERM_LOG environment variable can be used to adjust the level of logging.
Max verbosity in stdout start: C:\> WEZTERM_LOG=debug wezterm

INSTALATION:

C:\Users\...\Desktop\WezTerm

1a) install Wezterm
https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/installation.html
https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/install/windows.html
download :simple-windows: Windows (zip) for a standalone version

OR ANY OTHER:
$ winget install wez.wezterm
$ winget upgrade wez.wezterm  # to later upgrade it

$ scoop bucket add extras
$ scoop install wezterm

$ choco install wezterm -y


1b) Copy wezterm.lua file under the same directory where wezterm.exe exists.

CONCLUSIONS:
The desired font and color scheme are packaged withing WezTerm. Nvim will leverage those. No ttfs need to be manually installed,
unless of course a different non-existent font is to be configured.




Windows 8+ is required.

winget install Neovim.Neovim

choco install neovim (use -y for automatically skipping confirmation messages)

scoop bucket add main
scoop install neovim



Mason is installed by Lazy, however it needs the following requirements (Windows):
pwsh or powershell
git
GNU tar
One of the following:
7zip
peazip
archiver
winzip
WinRAR


scoop list
Installed apps:

Name Version Source Updated Info
---- ------- ------ ------- ----
fd 10.2.0 main 2024-09-29 04:18:21
ripgrep 14.1.1 main 2024-09-29 04:12:19

ripgrep for ff
fd probably for the same reason


Note: Scoop requires pshell of version 5.1+. 5.1 is included in windows. Later versions come as standalone.
get-host|Select-Object shows the version

scoop instalation:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression

Get-ExecutionPolicy to see the state. Most likely restricted at the beginning.

$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode to check if the system is in ConstrainedLanguage mode.

If powershell is not allowed to set execution policy due to admin restrictions, a solution is to install pwsh.
Powershell (version 5.1+) comes by default with windows. Later versions must be installed manually.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows
Better to install pwsh (version 7.5 or whatever) manually via the zip file and add it to the path and use that instead.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5#installing-the-zip-package


Best solution seems to be bypassing scoop (and powershell permissions) and simply install the following via winget:

Needed by Telescope plugin:
winget install sharkdp.fd
winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC

Needed for Mason pkg manager:
winget install -e --id RARLab.WinRAR

These should be installed by default in Windows, but also double check:
- GNU tar
- powershell

For git, better to get the latest. However, for a relatively new-ish version:
winget install -e --id Git.Git


At this point, replacing the nvim configuration and restarting will update it with new details. The config is thrown under:
C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\ and the folder name will be nvim, as per the folder containing the config in this repo.

Now, due to proxy issues behind an administrated network, multiple concurrent SSH connections will be blocked when attempting
to update the plugins installed by lazy. There is a config under the following folder that defines the maximum allowed concurrent
connections:
C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\nvim-data\lazy\lazy.nvim\lua\lazy\core\
Setting it to 1 will solve that issue.
This has also been set programatically under the lazy.lua config file.

Anything that is installed (plugins, pakage managers, etc.) is sent under:
C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\nvim-data
For a hard reset, simply removing the folder and starting nvim again will result in a fresh sl
