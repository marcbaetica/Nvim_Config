COLOR SCHEME AND FONT CONFIGURATION:

https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/fonts.html#font-related-configuration

WezTerm ships with over 700 color schemes available from iTerm2-Color-Schemes, base16, Gogh and terminal.sexy and a couple of other locations.

config.color_scheme = "Catppuccin Macchiato"


https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/appearance.html#defining-your-own-colors

By default, WezTerm bundles JetBrains Mono, Nerd Font Symbols and Noto Color Emoji fonts and uses those for the default font configuration.

config.font = wezterm.font("JetBrains Mono Medium")
config.font_size = 16

... also need fallback font
https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/wezterm/font_with_fallback.html?h=jet+brains+mono
for nvim opened directly through cmd a fallback font would support emojis



DEBUGGING Wezterm:

Ctrl + Shift + L (default config) activates the debug overlay which contains the most recently logged issues as well as a Lua REPL for evaluating built-in lua functions.

WEZTERM_LOG environment variable can be used to adjust the level of logging.
Max verbosity in stdout start: C:\> WEZTERM_LOG=debug wezterm

$ winget install wez.wezterm
$ winget upgrade wez.wezterm  # to later upgrade it

CONCLUSIONS:
The desired font and color scheme are packaged withing WezTerm. Nvim will leverage those. No ttfs need to be manually installed.




Windows 8+ is required.

winget install Neovim.Neovim

choco install neovim (use -y for automatically skipping confirmation messages)

scoop bucket add main
scoop install neovim



Mason is installed by Lazy, however it needs the following requirements (Windows):
pwsh or powershell
git
GNU tar
One of the following:
7zip
peazip
archiver
winzip
WinRAR


scoop list
Installed apps:

Name Version Source Updated Info
---- ------- ------ ------- ----
fd 10.2.0 main 2024-09-29 04:18:21
ripgrep 14.1.1 main 2024-09-29 04:12:19

ripgrep for ff
fd probably for the same reason


Note: Scoop requires pshell of version 5.1+. 5.1 is included in windows. Later versions come as standalone.
get-host|Select-Object shows the version

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows
Better to install pwsh (version 7.5 or whatever) manually via the zip file and add it to the path and use that instead.


scoop instalation:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression

Get-ExecutionPolicy to see the state. Most likely restricted at the beginning.

$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode to check if the system is in ConstrainedLanguage mode.



better... install fd and ripgrep via winget
winget install sharkdp.fd
winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC

for winrar:
winget install -e --id RARLab.WinRAR

also check for GNU tar and powershell (should come by default) and that git is also installed
