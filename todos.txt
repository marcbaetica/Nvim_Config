Configuration ~
- WARNING Missing user config file: C:\Users\Marc\AppData\Local\nvim/init.lua
  - ADVICE:
    - :help |config|


:help confing

7. Load user config (execute Ex commands from files, environment, â€¦).
	$VIMINIT environment variable is read as one Ex command line (separate
	multiple commands with '|' or <NL>).
					*config* *init.vim* *init.lua* *vimrc* *exrc*
	A file containing initialization commands is generically called
	a "vimrc" or config file.  It can be either Vimscript ("init.vim") or
	Lua ("init.lua"), but not both. *E5422*
	See also |vimrc-intro| and |base-directories|.

	The config file is located at:
	Unix			~/.config/nvim/init.vim		(or init.lua)
	Windows			~/AppData/Local/nvim/init.vim	(or init.lua)
	|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME|	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/init.vim	(or init.lua)

	If Nvim was started with "-u {file}" then {file} is used as the config
	and all initializations until 8. are skipped. $MYVIMRC is not set.
	"nvim -u NORC" can be used to skip these initializations without
	reading a file.  "nvim -u NONE" also skips plugins and syntax
	highlighting.  |-u|

	If Nvim was started with |-es| or |-Es| or |-l| all initializations until 8.
	are skipped.
						*system-vimrc* *sysinit.vim*
     a. The system vimrc file is read for initializations.  If
	nvim/sysinit.vim file exists in one of $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, it will be
	used.  Otherwise the system vimrc file is used. The path of this file
	is given by the |:version| command.  Usually it's "$VIM/sysinit.vim".

						*VIMINIT* *EXINIT* *$MYVIMRC*
     b. Locations searched for initializations, in order of preference:
	-  $VIMINIT environment variable (Ex command line).
	-  User |config|: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/init.vim (or init.lua).
	-  Other config: {dir}/nvim/init.vim (or init.lua) where {dir} is any
	   directory in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS.
	-  $EXINIT environment variable (Ex command line).
	|$MYVIMRC| is set to the first valid location unless it was already
	set or when using $VIMINIT.

     c. If the 'exrc' option is on (which is NOT the default), the current
	directory is searched for the following files, in order of precedence:
	- ".nvim.lua"
	- ".nvimrc"
	- ".exrc"
	The first that exists is used, the others are ignored.


:Tutor<Enter> to revisit as a refresher.

Add fuzzy searcher.

netrw is the default vim file explorer. :Ex <dir>
